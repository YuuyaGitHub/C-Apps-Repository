# Minecraft Log Viewer
This program displays the Minecraft log (latest.log) in real time.

# Argument
**Probably won't work :)**
<br>If you specify the `customfolder` argument when running it, the latest.log in the specified location will be displayed.
<br>This allows you to specify a custom directory such as the directory where the MOD is installed.

# Requirements
Below are the requirements needed to run this program:

* Minecraft is installed and the .minecraft folder exists
* Minecraft log file (latest.log) exists
* Minecraft is running

# known bugs
* Due to a code mistake (```javaw``` is supposed to be ```Minecraft```), it doesn't work at all. This will be fixed soon.

# Download
This program can be downloaded from [this](https://github.com/YuuyaGitHub/CS-Apps-Repository/raw/main/Minecraft%20Log%20Viewer/bin/Release/Minecraft%20Log%20Viewer.exe) link.
