# Minecraft Log Viewer
This program displays the Minecraft log (latest.log) in real time.

# Argument
**Currently this is not working. We plan to fix this in the future.**
<br>If you specify the `customfolder` argument when running it, the latest.log in the specified location will be displayed.
<br>This allows you to specify a custom directory such as the directory where the MOD is installed.

# Requirements
Below are the requirements needed to run this program:

* Minecraft is installed and the .minecraft folder exists
* Minecraft log file (latest.log) exists
* Minecraft is running

# Bugs
## Known
* As shown above, the `customfolder` argument doesn't work.
## Fixed
* Fixed on 5/3/2024 - Due to a code error, it is determined that Minecraft is not running even though it is running.
