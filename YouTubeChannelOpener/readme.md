# YouTube Channel Opener
This program will open the channel with specified youtube channel ID.

# Supported Formats
❌ YouTube handle (like youtube.com/@username)
<br>❌ Custom URLs (like youtube.com/c/username)
<br>⭕ Channel ID (like youtube.com/channel/id)

# How to Use
Just run it with `/id:(Channel ID of the channel you want to open)` as an argument after `YouTubeChannelOpener.exe`.
<br>Help is displayed if the arguments are incorrect or not specified.
<br>No channel ID checking is done for non-existing channels, so you can enter any string of characters. However, if I enter a channel id that does not exist, I get a "404 not found".

## Example
The following command is for opening my YouTube channel:
`YouTubeChannelOpener.exe /id:UCKMQY0OXZhdiRnbGN9Nm5kA`
