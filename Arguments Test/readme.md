# Arguments Test
This program is for testing the operation of arguments.

# How did you make it?
I don't have the knowledge to do it myself, so I let [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) generate this code for me :)

# List of arguments
| Arguments | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| /s | Display the characters that say "あああ" |
| /k | You will be prompted to press any key. |
| /y | Your browser will launch and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) will open. |
| /name:[Any Text] | Display arbitrary text. For example, if you enter "/name:ABC", it will be displayed as "ABC". <br>Do not include spaces (e.g. "/name: ABC"). If you enter a blank, it will not be displayed. |
| /? | Display help.|
