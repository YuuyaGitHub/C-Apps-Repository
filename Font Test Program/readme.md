# Font Test Program
This program allows you to test fonts using fonts installed on your system.

# Features
* You can freely change the font size (between 1-9999) and style.
* You can enter sample text.
* You can enter any characters.

# Sample Text
You can enter sample text by selecting "Enter Sample Text" from the menu bar.
<br>The content to be entered at this time can be defined in ``sampletext.txt```.
<br>If this file does not exist, it can still be generated, but hard-coded example text will be used instead.

Note that sampletext.txt is not included in this repository. Please create it yourself.
