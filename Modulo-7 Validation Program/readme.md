# Modulo-7 Validation Program
This program validates Modulo-7 keys (in the format ```xxx-yyyyyyy```).

# Disclaimer
This tool **does not always give correct results**.
<br>At least, we have confirmed that this tool returns ```111-1111111``` as "incorrect".

# Known bugs
* There are some places where hyphen removal does not work properly.
* As shown above, we consider some otherwise valid numbers to be "invalid", such as ```111-1111111```.
